1. We need Gunicorn for serving request on Heroku so install as below
pip install gunicorn
2. Create Requirements file
pip freeze > requirements.txt
3. Create Procfile with below command
web: gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker app:app

web: is specific to Procfile command convention that will help identify
the Heroku deployment process to start a web application with the command
next to it.
gunicorn is the WSGI server to which we are configuring our application
to run on, with the following configuration.
-w 4 indicates that we need our application to run on gunicorn with 4 worker processes.
-k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker tells the gunicorn to run the application using uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker worker class.
main:app is our module main where our FastAPI() app is initialized.
You can also specify the host and port. But Heroku will automatically figure them out
